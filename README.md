 ## 1. What's Mocra?
Mocra is a game project wich aims to improve my dev skills, especially in Networking. So Mocra is an online card collection, in fact this is a fusion between art and game-dev. All cards are created from scratch and aren't images from google (even if some images are inspired by artists, existing images).

The collection is divided into **series**, that are sets of cards in link. The collection is also divided into **editions**. A new edtion is created when there is big drop of new cards.

So cards can be classified easily beacause on top of the series and editions, there are many scarcities with different drop rate:
|Common|Not Much Common  |Unusual | Rare | Extremely rare | Unbeleivable |Mythic|Rainbow
|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|
| 1 - 0,7 | 0,7 - 0,1 |  0,1 - 0,05 | 0,04 - 0,01 | 0,01 - 0,007 | 0,006 - 0,003 | 0,002 - 0,001 | 0,0099 - -âˆž

The goal of the game is to cellect all of the cards but to do it with different ways: by opening packs, by trade, by playing mini-games.

The code of Mocra client is protected by **Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International (CC BY-NC 4.0)**, so you can use or modify it as you want (but not as commercial use). However the server is private, in this github don't have access to it to forbid private server.
